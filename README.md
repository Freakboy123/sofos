# SOFOS


App designed to help everyone explore our world. Thanks to posts in either text or video format, users can interact with them and briefly learn about various topics. 


Our objective with this app is to help people develop their general knowledge little by little by exploring a few posts every day. Our approach with this app is to introduce a specific subject in a holistic manner. Instead of covering it in detail, we aim for conciseness. Therefore, we see our platform to display posts which only take between 2 and 10 minutes to cover entirely. 


Entire code is written in JavaScript. The framework used to make the frontend of the mobile app is React Native (Expo CLI).
